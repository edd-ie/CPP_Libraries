### Classes vs Structs
Certainly! In C++, both classes and structs allow you to define your own custom types, but there are a few key differences between them:
- Default Member Accessibility:
    - Class: Members (variables and functions) of a class are private by default. This means that they are not directly accessible from outside the class.
    - Struct: Members of a struct are public by default. They can be accessed directly without any restrictions.
  
- Instance Naming:
    - An instance of a class is called an "object."
    - An instance of a struct is called a "structure variable."

- Member Classes/Structures:
    - Class: Member classes or structures within a class are private by default (although not all programming languages follow this default behavior).
    - Struct: Member classes or structures within a struct are public by default.

- Declaration Keywords:
    - A class is declared using the class keyword.
    - A struct is declared using the struct keyword.
- Typical Usage:
    - Class: Typically used for data abstraction, inheritance, and encapsulation.
    - Struct: Typically used for grouping related data together.
- NULL Values:
    - Class: Allows NULL values.
    - Struct: Does not allow NULL values.
Here are a couple of examples to illustrate these differences:
- Member Accessibility:

```c++
// Program 1: Using a class
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Test {
    int x;
};

int main() {
    Test t;
    t.x = 20; // Compilation error: 'int Test::x' is private
    return t.x;
}


// Program 2: Using a struct
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

struct Test {
    int x;
};

int main() {
    Test t;
    t.x = 20; // Works fine
    cout << t.x; // Output: 20
}

- Inheritance:

// Program 3: Inheritance with classes
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Parent {
public:
    int x;
};

class Child : public Parent {
public:
    int y;
};

int main() {
    Child obj1;
    obj1.y = 7;
    obj1.x = 91;
    cout << obj1.y << endl; // Output: 7
    cout << obj1.x << endl; // Output: 91
    return 0;
}
```
In summary, while both classes and structs allow you to define custom types, their default member accessibility and intended usage differ. Choose the one that best fits your needs based on these differences  .
